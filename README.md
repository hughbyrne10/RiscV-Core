# Risc-V-Core
 RISC-V is an open standard instruction set architecture based on established reduced instruction set computer principles. Unlike most other ISA designs, the RISC-V ISA is provided under open source licenses that do not require fees to use.

The intent is to implement all base instructions from the RISC V 32I instruction set. ECALL, EBREAK and FENCE will be implemented as NOP. CSR instructions will be omitted for now.
This leaves 38 instruction total.
